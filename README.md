## Network Structure

![](figure/figure2.png) 

## Requirements
- Tested with Python 3.6
- CUDA 9.0 or higher
- PyTorch 1.1.0 
- torchvision 0.3.0 
- numpy 1.16.4
- albumentations 0.3.0

## Task
Unsupervised domain adaptive segmentation

## Dataset
* Source domain: [Drosophila III VNC EM images](https://gitub.com/unidesigner/groudtruth-drosophila-vnc) 
* Target domain:  [EPFL Mouse brain Hippocampus EM images](https://cvlab.epfl.ch/data/em)

## Training Data Augmentation
- Flip, Transpose, Rotate, RandomSizedCrop, Resize, RandomBrightnessContrast, MotionBlur, ElasticTransform

The data augmentation library [Albumentation](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations)

## Training
Run `main.py` either in your favorite Python IDE or the terminal by typing:
```
python main.py
```
To obtain a more stable training process, we first train the segmentation network with the feature and label domain discriminators to get a better performance, and then jointly train the discriminators and the reconstruction network.

## Testing
* You can download the pre-trained models [III_VNC_to_Mouse_Brain_Hipp_model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsmcjuTqJmLS_Go2OajUO-iwTKTEkMsU/view?usp=sharing)ï¼Œthe details of the pre-trained models and testing steps are in the file named 'README.md' in the downloaded folder
